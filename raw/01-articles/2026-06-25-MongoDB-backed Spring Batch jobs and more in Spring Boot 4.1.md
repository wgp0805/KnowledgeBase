Spring Batch was introduced many years before MongoDB existed, and its design assumed the presence of a SQL database in which to store the state of Spring Batch jobs.

But that was _decades_ ago, and a common question for anyone new to Spring Batch was, _"Why does this thing need to talk to a SQL database?"_ The answer, of course, was that Spring Batch keeps a meticulous record of every job, step, and execution in a `JobRepository`, and for years that repository spoke one dialect: SQL. If you were happily living in MongoDB-land, you still had to drag a Postgres or MySQL instance along just so Batch could write down what it did last Tuesday.

In recent Spring Batch iterations, Spring Batch decoupled its `JobRepository` from JDBC, and Spring Boot 4.1 finally puts a bow on the experience with a proper `spring-boot-starter-batch-data-mongodb` autoconfiguration. You get the same zero-config Boot experience for your batch metadata that JDBC users have enjoyed since the beginning.

Fun fact: Dr. Dave Syer, cofounder of Spring Boot, was the founder and longtime lead of Spring Batch. Naturally, the first autoconfiguration he wrote for Spring Boot was for Spring Batch! So when I say that Spring Boot users have enjoyed JDBC-backed support in Spring Boot since the _very beginning_ , I mean it!

This post walks through a small but complete example. It:

  * Stores the Spring Batch `JobRepository` in **MongoDB** (via the new 4.1 starter).
  * Reads `customers.csv` from the classpath.
  * Writes the rows into a **PostgreSQL** `customers` table.
  * Runs everything against services launched by a `compose.yaml` in the project root.



## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#getting-the-infrastructure-up>)Getting the infrastructure up

Before we touch a line of Java, spin up the two backing services:
    
    
    docker compose up
    

The `compose.yaml` brings up a MongoDB instance configured as a single-node replica set (Batch's MongoDB support needs transactions, and transactions need a replica set), a PostgreSQL instance for the destination table, and a Grafana LGTM container for observability if you want it later.

The job we'll define is a simple ETL (extraction, transformation, load) job that reads from a `customers.csv` file and writes to a table called `customers` in a PostgreSQL database.

We'll need to initialize the Postgres `customers` table; that's handled by `src/main/resources/schema.sql`:
    
    
    create table if not exists customers (
        id    serial primary key,
        name  varchar(255),
        email varchar(255)
    );
    

Spring Boot's SQL init (`spring.sql.init.mode=always`) runs it on startup. The MongoDB side is similarly self-serve — `spring.batch.data.mongodb.schema.initialize=true` tells the new starter to create the collections the `JobRepository` needs.

The relevant bits of `application.properties`:
    
    
    spring.mongodb.host=localhost
    spring.mongodb.port=27017
    spring.mongodb.database=mydatabase
    
    spring.batch.data.mongodb.schema.initialize=true
    
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/mydatabase
    spring.datasource.username=myuser
    spring.datasource.password=secret
    

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#the-job>)The job

Our job is called `etl`, and it runs two steps in sequence:
    
    
    @Bean
    Job job(@Qualifier(STEP_RESET) Step stepReset,
            @Qualifier(STEP_FILES_TO_DB) Step stepFilesToDb) {
        return new JobBuilder("etl", this.repository)
                .start(stepReset)
                .next(stepFilesToDb)
                .incrementer(new RunIdIncrementer())
                .build();
    }
    

First `reset` (a tasklet that wipes the destination table), then `files-to-db` (the reader → processor → writer that actually moves data). The `RunIdIncrementer` is a small but important detail: it bumps a `run.id` parameter on each launch so that Spring Batch treats every invocation as a new job instance instead of refusing to re-run a "completed" one.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#step-one-a-tasklet>)Step one: a tasklet

The simplest kind of Spring Batch step is a `Tasklet` — a single chunk of work with no notion of reading or writing items. It's the right tool when you just need to _do_ something between steps. Here it's a clean slate:
    
    
    @Bean(STEP_RESET)
    Step cleanTableStep(JdbcClient db, JobRepository repository) {
        return new StepBuilder("reset", repository)
                .tasklet((contribution, chunkContext) -> {
                    db.sql("delete from customers").update();
                    return RepeatStatus.FINISHED;
                })
                .build();
    }
    

The tasklet runs once, returns `RepeatStatus.FINISHED`, and we move on.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#step-two-reader-processor-writer>)Step two: reader, processor, writer

The interesting step is the chunked one. Spring Batch's bread-and-butter pattern is _read an item, process it, accumulate a chunk, write the chunk_. The reader pulls rows out of `customers.csv`:
    
    
    @Bean
    FlatFileItemReader<Customer> customerFlatFileItemReader(
            @Value("classpath:/customers.csv") Resource csv) {
        return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Customer>()
                .name("customer-reader")
                .resource(csv)
                .delimited(c -> c.delimiter(",").names("id", "name", "email"))
                .fieldSetMapper(fs -> new Customer(
                        fs.readInt("id"),
                        fs.readString("name"),
                        fs.readString("email")))
                .build();
    }
    

The CSV itself:
    
    
    id,name,email
    1,josh,josh@joshlong.com
    2,dashaun,dashaun@dashaun.com
    3,james,james@jamesward.dev
    

You get the idea.

The writer pushes each chunk into Postgres, using `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` so reruns don't blow up on primary-key collisions:
    
    
        @Bean
        FlatFileItemReader<Customer> customerFlatFileItemReader(@Value("classpath:/customers.csv") Resource csv) {
            return new FlatFileItemReaderBuilder<Customer>() //
                    .name("customer-reader")
                    .resource(csv)
                    .delimited(c -> c.delimiter(",").names("id", "name", "email"))
                    .targetType(Customer.class)
                    .build();
        }
    

And the step itself ties them together with a tiny pass-through processor (a great place to drop transformation, enrichment, or filtering logic later) and a chunk size of 10:
    
    
        @Bean
        JdbcBatchItemWriter<Customer> customerJdbcBatchItemWriter(DataSource dataSource) {
            return new JdbcBatchItemWriterBuilder<Customer>()//
                    .assertUpdates(true)//
                    .dataSource(dataSource)//
                    .sql("INSERT INTO customers(id, name, email) VALUES (:id, :name, :email) on conflict do nothing")//
                    .beanMapped()//
                    .itemPreparedStatementSetter((item, ps) -> {
                        ps.setInt(1, item.id());
                        ps.setString(2, item.name());
                        ps.setString(3, item.email());
                    })//
                    .build();
        }
    

Note the `faultTolerant()` switch and the retry policy — Spring Batch will quietly retry items that throw `IllegalArgumentException` up to ten times before failing the chunk. It's a one-liner because the framework is doing all the bookkeeping for you, and that bookkeeping is precisely the thing that now lives in MongoDB.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#run-it>)Run it

With Docker Compose up:
    
    
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    

The job kicks off, `reset` clears Postgres, `files-to-db` streams the CSV through the chunk pipeline into Postgres, and every step transition, item count, exit status, and execution timestamp gets written to MongoDB. Open up `mongosh`, and you'll see the familiar Batch collections — `BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE`, `BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION`, `BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION` — except they're documents now, not tables.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#observability>)Observability

Spring Batch jobs emit a whole bunch of interesting Spring `ApplicationEvent`s! I listen for one, `JobExecutionEvent`, which gets published whenever a job has finished (successfully or not).
    
    
        @EventListener
        void after(JobExecutionEvent event) {
            IO.println("Job execution #" + event.getJobExecution() + " finished");
        }
    

When I initialized the program with Spring Initializr, I made sure to add the `OpenTelemetry` Spring Boot starter. Spring Boot and Micrometer have long supported OpenTelemetry, but there was always some finagling required. Now, if you've got the OpenTelemetry starter on the classpath, it'll publish metrics to any OpenTelemetry endpoint (the default assumes port `3000`). If you choose Docker Compose support on the Spring Initializr, it'll give you a Grafana configuration that will listen for OpenTelemetry information on port 3000, too!

So, run the application, then visit localhost:3000, then click `Drilldown`, then `Metrics`, and then search for `spring_batch` in the search field.

Alternatively, you could visit <http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics> and see the same metrics. But I like shiny and colorful, so the Grafana page does a lot for me.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#bonus-native-images-with-graalvm>)Bonus: Native Images with GraalVM

GraalVM native image technology has the potential to reduce overall memory usage. Spring Batch already _mostly_ works with GraalVM native images, but there are some new classes I needed to account for. And some new schema files.
    
    
        static class Hints implements RuntimeHintsRegistrar {
    
            @Override
            public void registerHints(@NonNull RuntimeHints hints, @Nullable ClassLoader classLoader) {
                for (var c : new Class[]{
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.JobInstance.class,
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.ExecutionContext.class,
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.ExitStatus.class,
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.StepExecution.class,
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.JobExecution.class,
                        org.springframework.batch.core.repository.persistence.JobParameter.class,
                }) {
                    hints.reflection().registerType(c, MemberCategory.values());
                }
    
                var prefix = "org/springframework/batch/core/";
                for (var r : new String[]{
                        "schema-mongodb", //
                        "schema-drop-mongodb"}) {
                    for (var suffix : "jsonl,js".split(",")) {
                        var path = prefix + r + "." + suffix;
                        var resource = new ClassPathResource(path);
                        if (resource.exists()) {
                            hints.resources().registerResource(resource);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    

And we also need to tell GraalVM about `customers.csv` and the `Customer` POJO.
    
    
        static class ResourceHints implements RuntimeHintsRegistrar {
    
            @Override
            public void registerHints(RuntimeHints hints, @Nullable ClassLoader classLoader) {
                hints.reflection().registerType(Customer.class, MemberCategory.values());
                hints.resources().registerResource(new ClassPathResource("/customers.csv"));
            }
        }
    

Register both in the usual way by adding this to the `BatchConfiguration` class (or any class with `@Configuration` on it):
    
    
    @ImportRuntimeHints({BatchConfiguration.ResourceHints.class, BatchConfiguration.Hints.class})
    

Once this is done you can build a GraalVM native image in the usual way. I've written the steps down in the `native.sh` script in the root of the repository:
    
    
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    ls -la target && rm -rf target
    ./mvnw -DskipTests -Pnative native:compile
    ./target/batch
    

Run the application: `./target/batch` and observe that it starts up in no time at all and takes considerably less RAM than when run on the JVM. On my machine - an Apple M5 with macOS - it starts up in about a tenth of a second and uses about 150 MB of RAM. Long-running batch jobs aren't usually the sort of thing that _need_ fast startup, but the RAM savings is nice and the startup time doesn't hurt!

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#lazy-datasource-connections>)Lazy DataSource Connections

Another optimization that, in the sweep of things doesn't change all that much for this particular workload, but which is very nice, is that in Spring Boot 4.1 we now support _lazy connection retrieval_. Remember, by default Spring Boot initializes the DataSource and creates a connection whenever a transaction is started _even if_ there's no guarantee that you'll use the connection. You can avoid paying that penalty with the new Spring Boot configuration property `spring.datasource.connection-fetch=lazy`.

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#get-the-bits>)Get the Bits

As usual, the full code for this example is avaialble online [here](<https://github.com/coffee-software-show/2026-06-21-boot-41-batch-and-mongodb>).

## [](<https://spring.io/blog.atom#why-this-matters>)Why this matters

The historical coupling between Spring Batch and a relational database was always a pragmatic compromise, not a design ideal. The framework needs _somewhere_ durable to remember what it did, and SQL was the path of least resistance. With the `JobRepository` abstraction now properly decoupled — and Spring Boot 4.1 shipping first-class autoconfiguration for MongoDB — teams running on document stores no longer have to keep a JDBC database around just to humor the batch tier.

Pick the database that fits your data. Spring Batch will fit itself around your choice.
